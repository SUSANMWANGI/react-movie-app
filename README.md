# react-movie-app
React-MOVIE-APP is a modern, Netflix-inspired MOVIE explorer built with React and Vite. Users can search, browse, and favorite movies in a fast, responsive interface. This project demonstrates my expertise in React fundamentals, including component-based architecture, hooks (useState, useEffect, custom context hooks), state management, and conditional rendering. I implemented context API for global state, dynamic routing, and seamless user interactions with real-time updates. The UI leverages CSS Flexbox/Grid for responsive layouts and interactive elements. This app is a showcase of my ability to build scalable, maintainable, and engaging web experiences.

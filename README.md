# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# react-movie-app
React-MOVIE-APP is a modern, Netflix-inspired MOVIE explorer built with React and Vite. Users can search, browse, and favorite movies in a fast, responsive interface. This project demonstrates my expertise in React fundamentals, including component-based architecture, hooks (useState, useEffect, custom context hooks), state management, and conditional rendering. I implemented context API for global state, dynamic routing, and seamless user interactions with real-time updates. The UI leverages CSS Flexbox/Grid for responsive layouts and interactive elements. This app is a showcase of my ability to build scalable, maintainable, and engaging web experiences.
